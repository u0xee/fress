Data structures begin in a state of transience. 

All modify operations "consume" their argument, returning a structure appropriately modified.
This enables transient structural updates. For a split in data structure history, use a special
split command, which consumes and gives back two.

Data layout, especially of tree nodes.


Requirements:
Don't mix reading and writing - On the shared heap, pointer to atomic reference count.
 - Profile with perf under read (the data structures), write, and mixed, loads
Low thread contention from local calculations - pool counts per thread - implies local storage
 - Layer of indirection, would be inconsistent with local heap layout (would need polymorphism)
 - Paired pointers, one to data, one to local count. Memory overhead for pointers.
   Local heap objects need to be able to free other local objects. Need either a pointer to count,
   or embed count in target object, or mapping from objects to counts.
   Function of pointer to an integer somewhere.
    Integer can be - in object
                   - referenced by object
		   - referenced by pointer origin
		   - mapped to by data structure
    Objectives: smooth transition to shared status - how to coordinate this with any existent local pointers
    fast cloning and destroying of local references
    Slim references within heap
