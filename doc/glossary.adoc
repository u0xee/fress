aggregate:: a group (flock, herd). Information that is logically a grouping of other information, like a _list_ of telephone numbers.
alias::
  the act of making one reference -> into two, both referencing the same thing.
  Imagine you have a public-library reference number
[.caps]#api#:: application programming interface (and [.caps]#abi# -> application binary interface)
bespoke:: custom made, made to fit (a specific person or situation)
commission:: underwrite, bankroll, fund (roots in entrust)d
compile::
  transform an input set of instructions (usually in a human-friendly form),
  into an output set of instructions (usually in a machine-friendly form)
complect:: entangle, entwine, braid
coupling:: tied together, entwined
data structure:: a computer representation of some information
easy:: requires little effort
edn:: see <<edn>>
execute:: run a program; perform the instructions
explicit:: marked. called out.
framework:: a system for creating and running programs
fressian:: see <<Fressian>>
human-friendly:: readable or writable easily by humans, as opposed to machine-friendly (readily understood by computers or programs)
implicit:: implied. assumed. contextually apparent.
information:: data, specific chunk of knowledge
language:: a model for creating programs, and an accompanying text format for specifying model components
library:: a set of computing recipes, meant to be reused
list:: a sequence of things. Think grocery list.
map:: a mapping between keys and values
memory:: primitive storage units for the computer
parse:: to make sense of some notation
persistent data structure::
  a data structure whose meaning (information which it represents) remains the same (persists), as the program runs.
  In contrast, an _ephemeral_ data structure is designed with operations to change its meaning, as the program runs.
pointer:: a reference (most commonly) to computer memory
polymorphic:: not predetermined, decisions are made at runtime
pro:: professional
program:: computer instructions that you may ask your computer to perform
runtime::
  - a computing environment supporting your program, "java programs run inside the java runtime, but go programs run by themselves"
  - the time when a program is running, "the program won't know the file name until runtime, when the user will enter it."
    Especially as opposed to compile-time.
simple:: unentangled, not complected
stakeholder:: person who has some stake in the project. Will be affected by project in some way.
stricken:: incapacitated, disabled
