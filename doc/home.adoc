I'm Cole Frederick. I develop software and I used to teach undergrad computer science,
algorithms and data structures mostly.
I've spent way too much time tinkering with off-the-beaten-path software setups,
and I love learning about language and runtime implementations.
See some of my writing and gathered resources:

* For a few years I've been fiddling with some tree data structures in Rust,
  learning about topics as I go
** https://www.fress.io/story/forking-trees[Here] is an essay about the trees
** https://github.com/u0xee/fress[github.com/u0xee/fress^] -- the repository
** https://www.fress.io/bib[Here] are some papers related to the tree data structures
   (and some papers that I just thought were interesting)
** Posts about bug hunts while implementing polymorphism:
   https://www.fress.io/story/look-the-same[they look the same] and
   https://www.fress.io/story/panicked-while-panicking[the follow-up]
* A post about https://www.fress.io/story/seed-to-test[generative testing]
* A post about the hashing scheme https://www.fress.io/story/k12[Kangaroo Twelve]
* I love listening to tech talks,
  https://www.fress.io/story/watch-history[here] is a list of talks I've heard recently
* Humorous anecdotes:
