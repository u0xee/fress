I'm Cole Frederick. I develop software and I used to teach undergrad computer science,
algorithms and data structures mostly.
I've spent way too much time tinkering with off-the-beaten-path software setups,
and I love learning about language and runtime implementations.
See some of my writing and gathered resources:

* For a few years I've been fiddling with some tree data structures in Rust,
  learning about topics as I go
** Here is write-up about the link:story/forking-trees[trees]
** The https://github.com/u0xee/fress[repository^]
** Here are some link:bib[papers] relevant to the tree data structures
   (and some papers that I just thought were interesting)
** Posts about bug hunts while implementing polymorphism:
   link:story/look-the-same[they look the same] and the
   link:story/panicked-while-panicking[follow-up]
* A post about link:story/seed-to-test[generative testing]
* A post about the hashing scheme link:story/k12[kangaroo twelve]
* I love listening to tech talks; here is a
  link:story/watch-history[list of talks] I've heard recently
* Humorous anecdotes:
  link:story/fly-in-my-coffee[fly in my coffee],
  and link:story/raining-hair[raining hair]
