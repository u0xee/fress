= Memory in fress

The smallest unit of memory is called a Unit.
A Unit is the size of a machine word. A machine word
is the size of an address in the hardware memory system,
commonly 32 or 64 bits. A machine word is also the size
of the registers, the fundamental computational unit.

To store information, we borrow a segment of memory from
the pool of memory. A Segment is a contiguous group of
Units, and is identified by the address of its first Unit.
The first unit in a Segment serves as its anchor. An Anchor
records the size of a segment and facilitates sharing.
The other Units of the segment will store information.
