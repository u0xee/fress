In the middle of:
- bit in map guide to differentiate set from map

working on parity between growing to support a tail and shrinking during pop
- resolved, used a spare bit in Guide to indicate space for tail
- added logic to conj. Semantics of tail growth optimization are clear, not tied (only) to segment capacity

doc/notesPlacing the test compile checks into the segment code
- and fuzz functionality in segment code

Considering whether Segment::with_capacity should be cut,
in favor of only Segment::new(content_unit_count)
- implies indexing contents from 1..end => 0..end
-- implies rewrite of significant vector code.
