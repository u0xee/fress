= Polymorphism in fress-rust

There are different kinds of values. For example, there are several
types of numbers, and different kinds of collections.

== Base dispatch trait
* Common to all polymorphic objects on the heap
* Heap objects begin with one word, which gives access to the capacity
of the allocated chunk.
* Polymorphic heap objects have a vtable pointer as their second word.

== Polymorphism implemented

Methods on Value can be implemented as:
cast into ValueUnit,
differentiate into ValueImm or ValueRef,
Dispatch into ValueRef prism, or
predicate polymorphism for ValueImm
