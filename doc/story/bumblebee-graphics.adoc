Once I spent two weeks without proper graphics on my
day-to-day machine. I wasn't trying to run anything
exotic, believe it or not, I was running Debian.

Now the laptop I was using had a particular graphics setup.
When demand was low, it could use the on-chip Intel graphics
hardware, which was low power. When demand was high,
it could switch to using the dedicated NVIDIA graphics card,
off cpu.

Debugging the driver support for this graphics setup was
gnarly. I spent no less than two weeks running without an
X server, trying to make things work.

I finally got the system working the way I wanted,
but much to my disappointment when months later I
was installing Ubuntu, the automatic driver installation
got my graphics hardware working the very first time.

I felt pretty silly having spent so much time and
energy on it the first time. C'est la vie.
