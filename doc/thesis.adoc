Persistent data structures _are the crux of_ functional programming.
We find here a rich history; and an opportunity to apply it.
An age-old concept is incarnated as a modern-day _library_,
a set of recipes for persistent data structures,
compatible with a variety of languages and computing environments.

== Abstract
Programming with _values_ has many advantages over programming with _places_.
Where place-oriented constructs struggle :-( values convey, persist, endure and share with ease.
Code using places is by necessity _imperative_, a source of incidental complexity. Values overcome this problem.
Where place-oriented constructs aim to manipulate _computing substrate_, value constructs aim to manipulate _information_.
Many languages have spotty implementations of values, leaving programmers with a toolbox full of hammers.
Languages and runtimes often support numbers and strings as values, but donâ€™t have _aggregate_ values.
Aggregates are necessary tools.
Aggregate values are implemented with _persistent data structures_, most notably as trees that can share (_alias_) their components.
Runtime-dynamic aliasing like this requires runtime-dynamic memory recycling.
Aliasing and unaliasing can be _implicit_, where recycling happens in periodic sweeps,
or _explicit_, where recycling happens upon an explicit unaliasing event.
Currently, the most complete value implementations are integrated with some particular recycling runtime.
I aim to provide values to programmers in many languages, with persistent data structures using explicit aliasing.
These structures can be _driven_ by a runtime as rich as _C_, by exposing an _opaque pointer_ resource model.
