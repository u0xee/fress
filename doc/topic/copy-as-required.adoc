= Copy as Required 

Reference counting gives us something in return for explicitly 
tracking the number of incoming references,
a thread of control can now determine when a chunk of memory
is shared, and when it is not.



Copy on Write basically assumes memory might be shared,
so it always copies before a write/edit operation.

Copy as Required checks to see if the memory is shared,
and if not then it performs the writes/edits directly to the memory,
since no other operation is relying on its state.
Only if it finds the memory is shared will it fall back to Copy on Write
behavior, making a copy of memory before performing write operations.

Copy as Required Down a Tree

In fact, if you don't ever call split, operations on the
trees will never be required to copy because of sharing.
Sharing of memory is explicit when the programmer asks to split
one value into two.
