= Transparent Abstractions

Often we hear "it's an implementation detail" or
"that's the abstraction, you don't need to know how the
compiler/runtime/VM/OS does it.

And often I want to lean in, lower my voice and ask,
"Sure, but really, how does it work?"

Because often I actually need to know what's behind the curtain,
in order to make a determination on whether this works for my
use case or not.
How things are actually going to happen, at runtime in silicon,
(at least the gist or the rough plan) is central in deciding
what it is practical for.
