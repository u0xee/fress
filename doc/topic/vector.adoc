= image:logo/shield.svg[fress,47,link="./"] The Vector Tree

Recall that memory is one long array of storage units.
We chunk it up into smallish blocks of contiguous storage units.
When you see a diagram of a tree, such as on the right in the
picture below, remember that the tree will be embedded into linear
memory as shown on the left. And arrows pointing to tree parts,
are in fact merely addresses of those memory chunks.

In the diagram below, we can see a vector data structure growing
as more items are added to it. The lighter shaded boxes indicate
storage units that are not currently occupied.
You can see that as items are added, the vector will need to resize
to larger and larger memory chunks.

.4k vector
image::vector-4k.svg[vector,width=100%,align="center"]

This vector has grown quite large. It has over 4096 elements.
You can see here each grouping of 256 elements is drawn together
in a block. The arrows leaving the root each
conceptually connect to one block.

== Layout

```
Anchor, Distributor, Guide, Hash, Meta, Tail, Root

Empty Vector:
A D G

A D G R

A D G R R

A D G R R R

A D G R ... R

A D G T R ... R
      |
      -> X ... X

Guide, 8 bytes. If count fits in 16 bits:
a i h h | h h c c

a - offset from distributor to anchor
i - info byte, explained below
h - slot for hash code
c - count of collection

Else if count doesn't fit in 16 bits:
a i u u | c c c c

u - unused

Info byte in bit fields:
h? m? l? u | u ic ic ic
hash present?
meta present?
large count?
index of contents - 3 bits


Vector, Hash, Sort:
A D | G H? M? | Tail Root-Contents
A D | G H? M? | Pop  Root-Contents
A D | G H? M? | Keys Root-Contents

Tail is a segment storing the tail contents.

Pop is a population map describing the root contents.
- top 32 bits are key population
- bottom 32 bits are child node population
P N P N | K V K V K V K V

Keys is the number of keys in the root and height of the tree.
K K K K | N N N N N | V V V V
