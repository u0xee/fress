A D G R R

A D G R R R

A D G R ... R

A D G T R ... R
      |
      -> X ... X

Guide, 8 bytes. If count fits in 16 bits:
a i h h | h h c c

a - offset from distributor to anchor
i - info byte, explained below
h - slot for hash code
c - count of collection

Else if count doesn't fit in 16 bits:
a i u u | c c c c

u - unused

Info byte in bit fields:
h? m? l? u | u ic ic ic
hash present?
meta present?
large count?
index of contents - 3 bits


Vector, Hash, Sort:
A D | G H? M? | Tail Root-Contents
A D | G H? M? | Pop  Root-Contents
A D | G H? M? | Keys Root-Contents

Tail is a segment storing the tail contents.

Pop is a population map describing the root contents.
- top 32 bits are key population
- bottom 32 bits are child node population
P N P N | K V K V K V K V

Keys is the number of keys in the root and height of the tree.
K K K K | N N N N N | V V V V
